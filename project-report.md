# German Traffic Signs Classifier Project

The aim of this project is to classify the German traffic signs with deep convolutional neural network architectures using the [Tensorflow framework](https://www.tensorflow.org/).

## The Dataset

The dataset provided by the [German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB)](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb) and the details of the full dataset and the results of the final competition was reported by [the paper](http://image.diku.dk/igel/paper/MvCBMLAfTSR.pdf) written by J. Stallkamp and M. Schlipsing and J. Salmen and C. Igel.

The dataset used in this project is the same dataset provided by INI-GTSRB Benchmark with the images are prepared as downloadable pickle file formats by [Udacity self-driving car nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/drive). The datasets are available to download [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B8c3GUF4ZQ-_R29QOWxDTkRJV3c).
